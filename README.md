## About
This plugin is based on [offlineJ/ida-rpc](https://github.com/offlineJ/ida-rpc), but now it also shows some information when debugging. At the moment, apparently, this plugin is only supported by the 7.x IDA Pro versions.
In order to build this plugin i used IDA SDK v7.6



## Usage
To install IDADiscord, simply take the two binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/bakablaze/IDADiscord/releases) tab and drop them in the folder where all your plugins are located.

To change options within the plugin ```Edit -> Plugins -> IDA Discord``` or use the default hotkey ```Ctrl-Alt-R```

## Why?
I just wanted the plugin to be able to display information when debugging
